S3A is the most feature complete and robust client for interacting with S3 compatible object storage systems, successor to the S3N and S3 filesystem clients. While S3A makes every attempt to map the HDFS API closely to the S3 API, there are some semantic differences inherrent to object storage (Reference: Hadoop Wiki):\n\n\n\n\nEventual Consistency, with Amazon S3, or Multi-site Ceph. Creation, updates, deletes may not be visible for an undefined time.\n\n\nNon-atomic rename and delete operations. Renaming or deleting large directories takes time proportional to the number of entries and visible to other processes during this time, and indeed, until the eventual consistency has been resolved.\n\n\n\n\nEndpoints, Credentials, and SSL\n#\n\n\nThe default endpoint for S3A routes requests to Amazon S3 with SSL (TLS). When interacting with a Ceph object store you will need to change a few S3A configuration parameters, notably the endpoint should be the DNS name or IP address of your Ceph object storage API endpoint.\n\n\n\n\nEndpoint (\nfs.s3a.endpoint\n)\n\n\nSSL (\nfs.s3a.connection.ssl.enabled\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nIf HTTP(S) is included in the endpoint definition, then the SSL property is automatically adjusted as appropriate. We will use this convention in the later module when we update the Jupyter Notebook.\n\n\n\n\nLoading the sample data sets into Ceph object storage\n#\n\n\nTo load the data sets into your Ceph object store we will use S3cmd, a python CLI tool for interacting with S3 compatible object stores.

The first is to use a bucket domain name prefix, meaning the API request will be sent to whichever IP address the \n.\n hostname resolves to. If a wildcard DNS subdomain is not configured for the S3 endpoint, or if the endpoint domain name is not configured in Ceph, then requests using this convention will fail. The second way of routing requests is to use path style access, meaning the API request will be sent to \n/\n. We will create a bucket with all upper case letters, as this convention instructs the S3A client to use the latter, path style approach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate bucket for loading the sample metrics data set into Ceph object store\n\n\n\n\ns3cmd mb s3://METRICS\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will use the \nsync\n S3cmd command to synchronize the local directory with the downloaded data set with the newly created bucket.
